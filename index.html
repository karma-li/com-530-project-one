  <h1>Karma Li: Background & Ambitions</h1>
  <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Karma. I’m originally from China, but some of my family members live in
    the US, so I’ve been keeping traveling between China and the US for years. Now I’m a first year
    graduate student in IIT, majoring in Technical Communications and Information Architecture.

  <h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
  <p>
    How does one tell a story that attracts people? To answer this question, the first point popped
    up in my head is “to make it interesting”. And speaking of interesting, there is a field named
    entertainment devoting to holding the attention and interest of the audience. Although people’s
    attention is drawn by different things due to individuals’ different preferences in
    entertainment, most of the entertainment productions are approaches to communicate with the
    audience and bring them pleasure and delight. This makes me full of enthusiasm and drives me to
    pursue a career in the entertainment industry.

    In college, I was a broadcaster for the school’s radio and focused my interviews not just on
    luminaries, but on students. I also joined a start-up advertising firm and worked on branding
    and identity for small scale fashion and beauty brands that sold through WeChat. In 2017, I
    worked in post-production at a Beijing entertainment company. Although the experience gave me a
    deeper understanding of media in the Chinese market, I believe that to understand how to create
    and sell the entertainment productions that speak to an international audience, I need to pursue
    a communications degree in the US.

    Well, I’m here now. This is a new territory to me. I literally know nothing about the website
    design. Those terms, such as “html” and “css”, are really unfamiliar to me. I’m so glad that I
    take this class and have the opportunity to get to know all of these knowledge. It’s also the
    first time for me to use the “terminal” on my computer. Althought the codes are very hard to
    memorize, it seems to be fun to learn. I’m not expecting to master it after this class, but I do
    want to get familiar with the knowledge of website design and learn more from the professor and
    classmates. Hopefully I can be much better at it after this semester!
